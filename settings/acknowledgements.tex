I want to give a big thank to my supervisor Prof. Michael Gerndt. He gave me the initial idea of this thesis. During the project phase he also followed my progress continuously and gave instant feedback. I found the discussions between us are quite happy and enjoyable. Every time we talked, I felt my goal becomes more concrete.

I would like to thank the Espressif community as well. Espressif is the manufacturer of the microcontroller I used in my thesis but they are definitely more than that. Thanks to the help of the community I have met many nice people who gave me hints to solve the issues occurred in the implementation. Their vivid working atmosphere and confidence in their own products are another two reason that I decided to join in. If thing works smoothly I will start the job at Espressif from this December.

And also thanks to my roommates. The Corona pandemic is an unforgettable expedience in my lifetime and it has bounded us closer. After three years of living together we are finally going to tear apart. I will miss you!

And finally thanks for my parents. They have financed my study abroad in Germany. I miss them so much and I will go home soon!
