Counting human targets in buildings and rooms has many applications, such as elder care, heating optimization, and security. To protect the privacy of monitored humans, a low-resolution IR camera is placed at the top of the doorway to count enter and exit events. The collected images are interpolated and human objects are segmented from the background according to their temperature difference. The separated human targets are represented as binary blobs and further abstracted to centroids and central points. The human targets are associated with their respective trajectories by the nearest neighbor method and a filter. The results show an average of 95\% accuracy in the test environment and 81\% accuracy in the real environment. The algorithm is deployed on an inexpensive ESP32 microcontroller to reduce the cost.
